Document 00321: cystic fibrosis comparison of two mucolytic drugs for inhalation treatment acetylcysteine and arginine hydrochloride clinical bronchoscopic spirographic scintigraphic and chemical analyses were done in children with cystic fibrosis to assess the mucolytic effects of acetylcysteine inhalations versus l arginine hydrochloride aerosols the latter drug is less active than acetylcysteine and should not be used to treat children with cystic fibrosis 
Document 00592: treatment of mucus hypersecretion in human disease treatment of mucus hypersecretion in human disease should first be directed at prevention the hypersecretion of mucus even in the absence of pus in the sputum or of other signs of infection is of itself associated with significantly poor lung function infection is probably the important stimulus in cystic fibrosis certain anti inflammatory agents are now known to cause retention of mucus within the secretory cells although the rate of synthesis is not raised it may be that this offers a new way of control on the other hand the cells become larger and this may be undesirable i would prefer to see a study of the effect of drugs on the cellular stages of synthesis and discharge rather than concentration on mucolytic agents 
Document 00546: bronchial drainage with aerosol medications in cystic fibrosis examined in this study are the immediate effects of bronchial drainage preceded by the inhalation of aerosol solutions of a mucolytic agent a bronchodilator and their combination upon four measures of pulmonary function in patients with cystic fibrosis on three separate occasions pulmonary function was tested preceding and following treatments consisting of one of the above three aerosol solutions followed by bronchial drainage the order of solutions used was random and each subject received one treatment with each solution the greatest overall improvement in function was seen with the bronchodilator and bronchial drainage the combination of the bronchodilator mucolytic agents and bronchial drainage was the next most effective technique the mucolytic agent when used alone with bronchial drainage decreased function comparison of the pulmonary function scores indicated a significant difference among the three treatments
