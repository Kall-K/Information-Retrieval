Document 00546: bronchial drainage with aerosol medications in cystic fibrosis examined in this study are the immediate effects of bronchial drainage preceded by the inhalation of aerosol solutions of a mucolytic agent a bronchodilator and their combination upon four measures of pulmonary function in patients with cystic fibrosis on three separate occasions pulmonary function was tested preceding and following treatments consisting of one of the above three aerosol solutions followed by bronchial drainage the order of solutions used was random and each subject received one treatment with each solution the greatest overall improvement in function was seen with the bronchodilator and bronchial drainage the combination of the bronchodilator mucolytic agents and bronchial drainage was the next most effective technique the mucolytic agent when used alone with bronchial drainage decreased function comparison of the pulmonary function scores indicated a significant difference among the three treatments 
Document 00542: letter questions regarding arginine hydrochloride inhalation with regard to the recent study of dietzsch et al on the use of arginine hydrochloride inhalation in cystic fibrosis patients i wish to point out that these investigators acted irresponsibly in exposing their patients for an appreciable period seven weeks to a preparation which is known to be irritating i would suggest that the deleterious effects seen by dietzsch et al are due to their inattention to experimental detail and lack of communication with other investigators dietzsch et al give the impression in their article that all arginine solution are detrimental to the lung we wish to point out that l arginine hydrochloride buffered with a sodium solution is irritative to the airway of cystic fibrosis patients however no comparison studies were done with l arginine buffered with free base the fate of these children with cystic fibrosis depends on the quality of the inhalation treatment this means if you replace a good mucolytic drug with a better one you step by step approach the ideal mucolytic solution we think it to be unethical to use other less effective drugs or solutions in a control group e g saline or distilled water we did not state that arginine solutions are irritative or that arginine treatment is dangerous the n acetylcysteine solution which was successfully used before the treatment of our patients was buffered with sodium hydroxide to a ph of the quantity of sodium which was administered during each inhalation amounts to only mval of sodium so that an injurious pharmacological effect can be excluded both drugs were well tolerated and had no deleterious effects 
Document 00592: treatment of mucus hypersecretion in human disease treatment of mucus hypersecretion in human disease should first be directed at prevention the hypersecretion of mucus even in the absence of pus in the sputum or of other signs of infection is of itself associated with significantly poor lung function infection is probably the important stimulus in cystic fibrosis certain anti inflammatory agents are now known to cause retention of mucus within the secretory cells although the rate of synthesis is not raised it may be that this offers a new way of control on the other hand the cells become larger and this may be undesirable i would prefer to see a study of the effect of drugs on the cellular stages of synthesis and discharge rather than concentration on mucolytic agents
